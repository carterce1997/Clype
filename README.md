# Clype 2.0
# Authors: Jared Heidt, Chris Carter

In	this	multi-part	programming	project,	we	design	and	implement	Clype (short	for	Clarkson	
Skype),	an	instant	messaging	application	akin	to	Skype	that	runs	as	a	standalone	application.	
Incidentally,	the	word	‘clype’	in	Scottish	slang	stands	for	a	person	who	tells	tales:	
https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/clype).	In	Clype	2.0	(the	second
version	of	Clype),	we	implement	an instant	messaging	and	file-sharing	graphical	user	
interface	(GUI)	application.	


TO-DO:
1) ~~auto-scroll to bottom of conversation on conversation box (DONE)~~
2) ~~expand messages box width. In other words, users sent locally should be displayed to
   right of conversation box~~
3) Add spacing between bottom of screen and the last message shown. The message box must be "full" or filled with messages to see this. There is not enough room between the last message and the bottom of the message window.  
4) Add an message box/error box on right side of screen level with "Send Message Window." This will display text if a photo is ready to      send, if the user sends an empty input, or if the chosen file is not "good"
5)
