# Clype 2.0
# Authors: Jared Heidt, Chris Carter

In	this	multi-part	programming	project,	you	will	design	and	implement	Clype (short	for	Clarkson	
Skype),	an	instant	messaging	application	akin	to	Skype	that	runs	as	a	standalone	application.	
Incidentally,	the	word	‘clype’	in	Scottish	slang	stands	for	a	person	who	tells	tales:	
https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/clype).	In	Clype	2.0	(the	second
version	of	Clype),	you	will	implement	an instant	messaging	and	file-sharing	graphical	user	
interface	(GUI)	application.
